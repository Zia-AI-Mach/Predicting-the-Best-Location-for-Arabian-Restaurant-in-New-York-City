## Predicting-the-Best-Location-for-Arabian-Restaurant-in-New-York-City

Data collection process was started by getting them from the following website link: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset". After that, venues were found for each neighborhood by using the FourSquare API and Arabian Restaurants were attempted to be filtered out. In addition to that, some individual neighborhoods were explored to get general idea about the venues in the most popular Borough. Next the rankings of the neighborhoods using python's Folium library were visualized. Some mean values were computed to check the most common restaurants in the neighborhoods in general. Finally, k-means clustering algorithm were used to figure out the different prominent location to open a new Arabian Restaurant.
